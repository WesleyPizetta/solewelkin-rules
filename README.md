Solewelkin is an international chatting group. It is created in order to practice/improve English language, exchange cultures, and gain knowledge about other nations and countries. It is based on friendship. This group can be considered a family. The number of the group members are subject to changing, nonetheless, the group limit is 111 (formerly 100). Every group member is assigned a unique ID number to avoid confusion with people who have same name and nationality. All IDs are open to public meaning anyone can ask to view any ID. Members are free to enter and exit the group whenever they wish, however, it is possible that some members can be banned from the group temporarily or permanently because of the way they interact with other members. While members are allowed to talk about any topics (exceptions may apply), there are five crucial and strict rules in the group.

## Rules

#### 1. No Racism
Since members are a family in this group, racism has no place in it. Members will have a warning when they start discriminating other members that are from their country or other countries. 

#### 2. Respect
Members can have fun as long as they don't offend anyone. Abusing members through text, pictures, video etc. is disrespectful. Such behaviours will be asked for changes and apologies. 

**2.1** Swearing at members and calling names including unwanted nicknames<br/>
**2.2** Giving away membersâ€™ personal numbers, pictures, and videos to outsiders<br/> 
**2.3** Posting inappropriate pictures, videos, gifs, stickers, articles etc. in the group including sexual & disturbing content<br/>
**2.4** Belittling or humiliating other membersâ€™ cultural, national, personal, sexual & spiritual values and beliefs<br/>
**2.5** Extorting or pressuring members<br/>
**2.6** Harassing members with unwanted or sexual speech or implications<br/>
**2.7** Violating any of the rules of approved contests and events as described by the event-maker and/or other authorities<br/>
**2.8** Social excluding others from daily chats and/or events especially those whose bans were lifted and reentered the group<br/> 

#### 3. Only English
Speaking another language than English is disrespecting the group's purpose itself. Members will be warned about speaking a different language than English. On the other hand, members are allowed to ask the meanings of some words. Also, members are allowed to type words in different languages if they translate it to English between brackets unless exaggerated. 
For example: l'amour (love)

#### 4. Be Active
This rule applies only when group has 111 (formerly 100) members. This rule's purpose is to make group more social and active. Members who don't read or receive messages at all may be removed from the group without notice. Maximum one member may be removed from the group per day. Loyal members and new members up to 90 days of the original entry into the group are exempt from this rule. Members who attend the events but donâ€™t participate conversations in Solewelkin are considered to be active and most likely wonâ€™t be removed from the group due to lack of activity.

#### 5. Private Messaging
Members are not allowed to text each other in private without receiving permission in the group. If this rule is violated, it needs to be brought to the attention by filing a complaint. The result of this violation can be a warning or a temporary or permanent ban from the group depending on the contents of the private messaging and the times it has been violated. If a false complaint is made where the permission was in fact obtained, a counterclaim can take place. 

#### 6. No Scam Messages
Scam messages, like bitcoin links, free gift links, etc. are prohibited to be sent in the group. These links can often be dangerous that can put membersâ€™ privacy at risk. If any member sends a scam message, they will get asked to delete it and warned about it. Continued violation of this rule will cause them to be removed and possibly banned.

## Provision
#### 1. Private invite1. Private invite
Members who invite their friends to Solewelkin are responsible for their friendsâ€™ actions. If their friends violate the rules mentioned above, inviting members may also be drawn into investigation and face warnings and temporary bans. It is advised that members know the people they invite very well before they ask them to be added. 

------------



**CONSTANTLY VIOLATION OF THESE RULES AND PROVISION WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.**

#### Remarks
Those who were banned temporarily or permanently from the group due to violations of one or more of the rules mentioned above can apply for amnesty to be added back to the group. Amnesty for temporary bans must be approved by the majority of loyal members, and amnesty for permanent bans must be first pre-approved and then approved by the majority of group members. If a member does not respond to the amnesty application, it will be taken as "No, I do not wish this person to rejoin".
