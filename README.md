Solewelkin is an international chatting group. It is created in order to practice/improve English language, exchange cultures, and gain knowledge about other nations and countries. It is based on friendship. This group can be considered a family. The number of the group members are subject to changing, nonetheless, the group limit is 100. Members are free to enter and exit the group whenever they wish, however, it is possible that some members can be banned from the group temporarily or permanently because of the way they interact with other members. While members are allowed to talk about any topics (exceptions may apply), there are five crucial and strict rules in the group.<br/><br/>
	1.	No Racism
Remarks: Since members are a family in this group, racism has no place in it. Members will have a warning when they start discriminating other members that are from their country or other countries.<br/>
	2.	Respect
Remarks: Members can have fun as long as they don't offend anyone. Abusing members through text, pictures, video etc. is disrespectful. Such behaviours will be asked for changes and apologies.<br/>
	3.	Only English
Remarks: Speaking another language than English is disrespecting the group's purpose itself. Members will be warned about speaking different language than English. On the other hand, members are allowed to ask the meanings of some words. Also, members are allowed to type words in different languages if they translate it to English between brackets unless exaggerated. 
For example: l'amour (love)<br/>
	4.	Be Active
This rule applies only when group has 100 members. This rule's purpose is to make group more social and active. Members who don't read or receive messages at all may be removed from the group without notice. Maximum one member may be removed from the group per day. Protected members and new members up to 90 days of the original entry in the group are exempt from this rule. Members who attend the events but donâ€™t join conversations in Solewelkin are considered to be active and most likely wonâ€™t be removed from the group due to lack of activity.<br/>
5. Private Messaging
Members are not allowed to text each other in private without receiving permission in the group. If this rule is violated, it needs to be brought to the attention by filing a complaint. The result of this violation can be a warning or a temporary or permanent ban from the group depending on the contents of the private messaging and the times it has been violated.<br/><br/>
                        **Constantly violation of these rules will not be tolerated.**
